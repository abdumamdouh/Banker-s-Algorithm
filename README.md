# Banker’s Algorithm

The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm.

# Data structures
Let ‘n’ be the number of processes in the system and ‘m’ be the number of resources types.

Process Format P0, P1, P2, P3....
Resources Types Format A, B, C, ....


Available Vector : 

It is a 1-d array of size ‘m’.

Max Matrix:

It is a 2-d array of size ‘n*m’.

Allocation :

It is a 2-d array of size ‘n*m’.

Need Matrix :

 It is a 2-d array of size ‘n*m’.
